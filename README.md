# OpenSea Clone

## Description
The website I created is an e-commerce platform modeled after OpenSea, designed to enable sellers to showcase their products and buyers to easily browse and purchase items. This platform is accessible on any device, making it convenient for users to access from wherever they are. 
Through registration and authentication, users can manage their collections or add new items for sale, as well as add or remove items from their cart with ease. 

## Why
Prior to beginning this project, I completed a ReactJS course, and I decided to put my skills to the test by building an independent project. 
The prospect of creating a complete e-commerce website from scratch was an exciting challenge, and it was then that I discovered OpenSea, a visually appealing e-commerce website that allows users to publish their collections of items. 
I found it to be the perfect model and decided to replicate it. 

## What I learned
Throughout the project, I gained valuable knowledge on React Hooks, creating more efficient forms, promises in button events, Firebase (Database, Storage, Auth), React WebRouter, and date functions. 
Overall, this experience was enlightening, and I am proud to have created a functional and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce platform.
